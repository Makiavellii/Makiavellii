## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You may recognize me from my old name `jeebsAU` but I used to run a few projects in TF2. Nowadays I don't do a whole lot but make useless mods such as 2007 killfeed icons and replacing the mercenary badge with the cheater's lament.

## Things I've made/make:
- No Hats Mod
- Headsfeet Mod
- Respawn League Network Settings
- Rainbowmizer-Chaos Script
- SakiHUD
- 2007 killfeed icons
