## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You may recognize me from my old name `jeebsAU` but I used to run a few projects in TF2. Nowadays I don't do a whole lot but make useless mods such as 2007 killfeed icons and replacing the mercenary badge with the cheater's lament.

## Things I've made/make:
+ No Hats Mod & Headsfeet Mod
+ My own graphics config
+ [Respawn League][5] network settings
+ My own recording tool

## Find me via:
+ [Steam][1]
+ [Twitter][2]
+ [YouTube][3]
+ [TeamFortressTV][4]
+ Discord: jeebsxyou#1999

Contact me via Steam, Discord or Twitter if necessary.
